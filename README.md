# abortion-lottery-v1
Welcome to my first project! A game about abortion rights in the world, developed after 2 weeks at Ironhack!

You can play it here:

I wanted my work to be useful, so when I discovered I would have to build a game, I immediately had it all in my mind.
It was a challenge, because I absolutely wanted everyting to work the way I imagined it... and well, I did make it work.
Almost like in my head... except for the design! :D

Since the goal of this exercise was to learn how to use HTML/CSS, DOM manipulation, and javascript, I entirely focused on the logic, and not on the design!

Once the bootcamp is over, I would love to recreate my game with what I learned since I first released it!

Hope you'll like!
