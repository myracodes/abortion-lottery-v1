# Abortion Lottery (v1!)
Welcome to my very first project as a web developer!
**A game about abortion rights in the world, created in 4 days!**

## Play it here: https://myracodes.github.io/abortion-lottery-v1/

######About this project:
I had been learning Javascript, HTML and CSS on my own with online courses for a few months when I enrolled in a web development bootcamp.
**2 weeks after the bootcamp started**, our first solo project was to create a simple game using basic Javascript, **in just 4 days**.
I knew mine was ambitious (for this project, people typically code a tic tac toe game) but I knew I could do it.

Since the goal of this exercise was to use basic HTML/CSS, DOM manipulation, and Javascript, I entirely **focused on the logic, and not on the design!**

At some point, I would love to recreate this game with all the new skills I acquired since I first coded it!

######Future improvements include:
* **ACTUAL DESIGN** (not the point of the exercise, and in such a short amount of time: I **had to** shamelessly skip it...)
* make it playable on **smartphone** (without keyboard)
* make the game **responsive**
* **animations** (slot machine when in use, face of the character when she touches an object, ...)
* more states and countries, bonuses, maluses
* number of points won or lost appearing on the game board when collision occurs
* proper documentation of the code
* **sound effects and background music!**
* more context about the game: educational purpose
* add information at the end of each game about abortion rights in the country player was sorted in
* add a French version
* and more!!
